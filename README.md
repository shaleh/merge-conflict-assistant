Merge Conflict Assistant
------------------------

This is a language server implementation to assist with resolving merge conflicts in files. The conflicts
in a file will be returned as Diagnostics and show as errors like any other syntax error. Code Actions for
these are made available which will show the branch, tag, or whatever name is included in the conflict
markers.
